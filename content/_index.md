I develop performant solutions to complex scientific and industrial problems.
I am currently a product engineer at [Radar](https://radar.com/),
where I work on search systems, geocoding, machine learning, and some mathematical work to better interface
between the digital and physical worlds.

I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BMath in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics.

My previous experience has largely revolved around data-intensive embedded systems,
like software-defined radios for wireless communication.
I also have a number of projects where I worked with digital signal processing,
such as a low-cost solution for performing turbulent flow analysis using
ultrasonic sensors, and a [binaural audio localizer](https://github.com/davidgur/3d-sound-synthesis).

I am also interested in applied research, both in academia:
- I studied the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in performing graph clustering tasks at [OpAL Lab](https://opallab.ca/).
- I worked in David Del Rey Fernandez's [group](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/ddelreyf), where I investigated the possibility of solving certain classes of PDEs using [spiking neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network).
- I worked with [Sri Namachchivaya](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/people-profiles/n-sri-namachchivaya) to investigate non-parametric methods for performing quickest change detection on high-dimensional datasets with unknown pre- and post-change distributions.

and in industry:
- I iterated on existing algorithms capable of locating an RF-emitting device using TDoA with statistical methods, and
- I implemented novel methods for performing low-cost BLE emitter localization using machine learning methods.
